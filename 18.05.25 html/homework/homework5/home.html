        <i><h2>What Are Programming Languages?</h2></i>
        <p>Programming languages are a way for humans to give instructions to computers. They allow us to create software, websites, and digital tools that help solve real-world problems. Each programming language has its own rules and purpose, but all of them serve the same goal â€” to make computers do useful tasks. Programming is not just about writing code, but also about thinking logically, solving problems, and building creative solutions for everyday needs.</p>
